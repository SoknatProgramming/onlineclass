        If you’ve ever owned a pooch, you know how good it feels to treat your four-legged friend with tasty snacks, new squeaky dog toys or a comfortable bed. What makes the pampering even better, is that you know your dog appreciates it as much as you do.
        And if you need a special occasion for some doggy indulgence,<b><i>August 26th</i></b>  is the perfect day, for it is the International Dog Day – an officially great opportunity for puppy owners to get their friends a gift to show them they’re loved and appreciated. Another great occasion is your hound’s name day as you can throw him the best dog birthday party ever, with dog cakes and playmates. Of course, you could also get them a simple bone or a ball, but some of these cool dog gifts will make life easier or more fun for both of you.
